**Analyzing FactoryFuzzy E-commerce Data:** 
*This project was done based on the Mavenfuzzyfactory E-commerce data built by Maven Analytics where I executed SQL queries of different metrics related to traffic source, conversion rates, revenue & margin, channel portfolio, and many more metrics to analyse the business traffic and website performance. *

**I answered the questions such as:**
• Find the quarterly figures since the lunch of a new product, for sessions-to-order conversion rate, revenue per order and revenue per session. 
• Show the quarterly view of orders from Gsearch nonbrand, Bsearch nonbrand, brand search overall, organic search and direct type-in. 
• Pull sales data of the new primary product and see how well each product cross-sells from one another

**To answer these questions i used in different functions and methods. They include:**

- Creating temporary tables 
- “Pivoting” data with COUNT & CASE 
- Using Subqueries 
- Analyzing seasonality 
- Using DATEDIFF()
